your flair, "{flair}", has been set! In addition to the shiny piece of text 
next to your name, having a user-flair on DPP enables you to comment on 
partner-seeking posts. Please use this power responsibly. There's no need to 
leave a comment telling a user that you've PM'ed them, asking if the prompt 
is still open, or other sorts of partner-seeking behavior in the comments.
These sorts of comments will lead to your flair being revoked, and possibly 
prevent you from earning flair in the future.

If you have any questions about your flair, please don't hesitate to reach out 
[to the DPP mods in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/dirtypenpals&subject=Flair%20Follow-up)
